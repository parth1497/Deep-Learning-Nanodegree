## DCGAN - Street View Housing Number 
Implemented a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator. It is called a Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN for short. Since this dataset is slightly complex  a deeper network is used to to accurately identify patterns in these images and be able to generate new ones. 
Specifically, a series of convolutional and transpose convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator. It's also necessary to use batch normalization to get these convolutional networks to train.
